### Hi there!

This is the source code for my personal website, I'm currently updating/developing the site, and should hopefully be running in a few weeks (lol maybe).

Regardless, this project is completed in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. I chose to exercise my skills and test my front-end development skills.
